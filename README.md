             üî∞</a> Overview
     </b>
</h2>

Hello! üëã

My name is <a href="https://github.com/Legendary-Person">```Itish Srivastava```</a> and this is my first small project, a rather simple music player made using </br>
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-front-end-development/">```Frontend-Development-Technologies```</a>. 

My project exclusively plays songs by my favourite artist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NF_(rapper)">```NFRealMusic```</a>.

I have provided the code for my project, and have also listed the <a href="https://blog.hubstaff.com/technology-stack/">```Tech Stack```</a> involved in my project.

As I have used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/">```CSS```</a> for the first time, while only having some very basic knowledge of the language, I had to utilize some very non-conventional means to make my player look the way it does.

I learned the language while simutaniously working on this small project of mine.

I wouldn't recommend you to do the same if you find it difficult to pick up a new language, rather get to know a decent bit of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/">```CSS```</a> before starting with this project.

- GeeksForGeeks: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-music-player-using-javascript/">```How to make a Music Player?```</a>

Keep in mind that you can use <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-wamp">```Wamp```</a> to host your project without much of an issue. 

Make sure to read ```üì£ Note```, later in the ```README.md```, as I have mentioned a handful of points regarding this project.

Checkout ```üì∏ Gallery```, later in the ```README.md```, to see the project structure within your <a href="https://www.educba.com/what-is-ide/">```IDE```</a>.

            üì£ Note
    </b> 
</h2>

- The Music Player isn't API based, therefore you will need to either manually add the songs (a folder) in your project directory or use .mp3 links.
- You will need to host your project on a server (when locally stored), like Wamp Server because, for security reasons, your browser wouldn't access your local files.
- The webpage isn't responsive, meaning that it will not automatically resize itself according to the device you are using, in conclusion, looking at the final product on laptop/desktop will be different from looking at in on mobile phone.
